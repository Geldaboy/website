    Hello readers my name is Samuel and the reason why I chose to enroll on the Codenation course is because I have a huge
    passion for technology, ever since I grew up, I have always been fascinated by computers and understanding how
    they worked when I watched my Dad and friends use them. I originally studied computing & IT in college and chose the software 
    development path as website development is the one thing I wish to continue as a career, a dream job. 
</p>
<br>
<p>I hope that one day in the near future I will be at the skill level to know what to do independently and not need assistance
    for every advanced feature I wish to use. My plan for now is to look for either training or an Apprenticeship to get all the required skills I need
    to be able to stand on my own two feet. Once I have all the skill levels required for independancy I will
    look to work in a big business like Microsoft or Google.</p><br>
    
    <p>I also have a huge passion for Gaming and Music so I am highly considering making a business of developing
        websites for gamers and musicians who wish to advertise themselves online and maybe get some recognition out of it
    </p>

    <p>My Hobbies that I like to do in my spare time are Gaming, Skateboarding and playing the Guitar. I am a massive fan
        of Zombie related things whether it be in Games or Films/TV Shows etc.. and I love Horror related things that give
        me a good jump scare to get my adrenaline going and feel alive.
