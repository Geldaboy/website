<h2><u>Unit 1</u></h2>
<h2><u>Outcome 1</u></h2>
  <p>Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs</p>
 <h3><u>Scenario</u></h3>
   <p>You are wanting to set up as a consultant. To prove your knowledge you want to start by creating a blog talking about yourself, why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know. For each of the sections below asking you to describe, include around a paragraph of information about the topic.</p>

 <h3><u>1.1</u></h3>
   <p>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</p>
   <p>The purpose of using IT in businesses is many things, one of many being advertising through websites, ads etc..; the best way for a good business to be better known is to put themselves onto the internet and try to attract new customers. Most people these days use Google to solve their problems and to discover shops in their area that they may need to go to.
     <br><br>
      Another reason for a business using IT is that when the customer is making payments, whether it be through a bank card or through coins and notes, the person receiving the money from the customer will be using a till register to process that exchange which is a form of IT.
     <br><br>
      Almost every standard business will use a computer to work the business, such as managing transactions, accounting and handling money while keeping an eye on it. To send and receive emails or communicate with customers (customer support for example) and order new stock if they have run out of a specific product.
     <br><br>
      Businesses will also need security set up to protect their business from any threats or breaches. This could range from CCTV systems set up or Authentication software such as password locked doors and fingerprint scanner doors right down to anti-virus software and password protected files so any risks are immediately eliminated or reduced.
     <br><br>
      All businesses are in competition with each other so having an IT system is vital to succeeding as a business, researching what is currently trending can give any business an upper edge advantage. [1]</p>
 <h3><u>1.2</u></h3>
   <p>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</p>
   <p>To make a project successful you will need several things:
     <br><br>
      Money/Budgeting: 
      In business, without money, the project will just not happen, but if the business is quite small and doesn’t have a lot of money, a budget is imperative. The business should make a budget estimating how much they’re going to spend on everything in total while also keeping their businesses money amount in mind. If the project were to fail or not have the expected result, nothing would be worse than having spent every penny of the business into it to get a bad result. A good budget keeps spending limited and doesn’t risk spending over the amount.
     <br><br>
      Planning: 
      Once the business has figured out if they have enough money to spend on the project, they will begin the planning and discuss what is going to be required for the project and how it will become successful and what the needs are for it. Without planning, the entire project would just be uncoordinated, messy and have an unpredictable outcome (mostly fail).
     <br><br>
      Tools: 
      With any project whether it is being done on a computer or not, there will always be tools that are used to complete that project. It could range from a pen and paper, a hammer and nails, a word document on the computer and even coding software to help build a program or website; It’s essentially anything you use to complete a task. 
     <br><br>
      The tools needed to make a website would be software such as notepad, visual studio code with an internet browser to test the website and see if it runs correctly. It’s also recommended to have notes for the project so if you come back to it later or someone takes over, it is easy to familiarise yourself with the work quickly.
     <br><br>
      Skills/Knowledge: 
      The skills needed for website development is a basic understanding of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as these two together are required to make a basic functioning website. While JavaScript isn’t a necessity for a website it definitely improves it as once implemented, it allows you to have a variety of new interactions and features to play with.
     <br><br>
      The people working on the project should all be at a required skill and knowledge level to complete the task given to them. In website development, a team member should be assigned to a task that they have at least a basic understanding of. One person could be really good at the coding aspect but really bad at the design and colour aspects whereas another person could be artistic and really good with colours and design but can’t code anything so these two people could essentially make a great team together. 
     <br><br>
      Resources:
      When starting a website the first thing you will need is a domain name. It is the digital address of your website that people will use to connect to it. Without this, your website will not be online or accessible to people. A business email address will also be needed to show that the business is legit and a proper business rather than using a free email address everyone else uses as a lot of people may not trust the website then.
     <br><br>
      When building a website it has to be decided whether to use website building software such as WordPress or Wix etc.. where it is easier to create and can support drag and drop with most of the tools at hand for you or to make it from scratch by hand using notepad. Again it all depends on the business budget, skill/knowledge and tools or resources at hand. 
     <br><br>
      Once the website is done and finished the next step would be to get website hosting, this is where a host acts as the storage unit containing all the content that lives online so that when someone enters your domain name into the web browser, the browser will then get the content from the websites web host. There are a few typical types of web hosting such as shared, dedicated and free.
     <br><br>
      The business may want to have a logo to advertise the website or business, so designing a logo will require resources, such things being the software used to create, edit and modify images like photoshop right down to Microsoft paint. If the team doesn't have the skills required for graphic design then they could purchase images online to use or hire a graphic designer to do it for them, which would cost money. It is important to note that a business should always use high-quality images wherever they can as if they don’t then people visiting the page may be put off and lose trust immediately.
     <br><br>
      Review:
      To be successful the team should do a full review at the end of the project to discuss how it went for them and talk about what they could have done better and what they did good in and what they can improve on in the future, did they achieve their goal? Has it even been tested? 
     <br><br>
      All projects should be tested a good few times before it is released so that way there is a very slim chance of failure to use the product for any potential customers using it. So reviewing it all and making any last-minute adjustments if there’s any time is a good thing.
     <br><br>
      [2] [3] [4] [5]</p>
 <h3><u>1.3</u></h3>
   <p>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</p>
   <p>Firstly it is important to figure out what the stakeholder wants, so that way if you were to make a website for a customer it would meet their interests, this can range from colours, layouts, features or even implemented media, no one wants an image of a duck on a chicken website.
     <br><br>
      Make a project plan to plan out the task, there is so many programs/software that allows you to do that. A good idea would be to create a document using Microsoft word or google docs and specify anything relating to the project that you can use to help you out. Another great example is using Microsoft Excel to create something like a Gantt chart as it can give you a roadmap on what needs doing to complete the project by breaking down the processes. 
     <br><br>
      To carry out the tasks using IT you will need to have programs/software that can track where you’re up to, whether this is manually tracked by the project team or automatically tracked by the computer. An example of manually tracked software could be Trello or ClickUp, example for automatically tracked could be Harvest as it tracks hours and expenses in teams which could be really good for time management 
     <br><br>

 <h3><u>1.4</u></h3>
   <p>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</p>
   <p>There are many possible risks that could happen when working with digital projects so it is always best to put as many fail-safes in as possible. Some of the main examples of risks can be things like security breaches, data corruption/loss and even hardware failure.
     <br>
      When working with a project it is very important that any work you do is saved regularly and backed up to another device elsewhere, this is in case the system you are using breaks or becomes faulty as often it can lead to memory loss and any unsaved/saved data has a high risk of being lost. Where a system that crashes has a high chance to still have the saved data, it is still the best idea to do regular backups so it can be accessed if the whole system itself stops working forever. It can also allow you to have different versions of that project too.
     <br>
      Security breaches are another great risk, if it’s a big enough business people will try their luck to hack into the system if there isn’t any security set up properly as the hacker may want the data for themselves, to send a virus into the system to just try and bring the business down and even just to take the money from the businesses accounts.
     <br>
      When doing projects a more common risk is for it to just not go anywhere. This could be because of many reasons, a few examples could be; the business could run out of money and resources mid-project and have to scrap the entire thing due to it losing the support from paid workers or software. It could also be the design or layout not working out effectively for the product build stage leading to a sloppy product and lastly also a schedule risk where the team don’t finish the project on time and it is either missing elements and features that are part of the requirements/specification requested by the customer or the expected date is extended and the product then becomes worthless to the customer.
     <br>
      [10] </p>
 <h3><u>1.5</u></h3>
   <p>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</p>
   <p>The right kind of technology would be what matches the specification and is the most efficient. For example, if the customer asks for an iPhone specific app then you wouldn’t make the app specifically for windows phone. You also should keep the technology as simple and relevant to the project as possible, you don’t need to have more programs and software to be used than there needs to be. Also to select the right kind of technology should be suited to the person completing the specific task, for example putting a person who is used to coding swift for ios onto c# is going to create some difficulties as it may be out of their skill and knowledge level.
     <br>
      The way to get the most effective result out of a project with a team is by discussing with the team what they know and what they are comfortable with and figuring out which one will give the best result without impacting the work and group. Anything that helps manage the workload like Trello and a checklist can ease stress as everyone can know what to do then.
     <br>
      [11] </p>
 <h3><u>1.6</u></h3>
   <p>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</p>
   <p>Using Trello for my planning has helped loads because it can help me keep track of where I am up to with my project and helps me not get lost on what needs doing. If I struggle with something on an assignment as big as the one I am doing right now, I can move onto the next question and come back to it later without having to review the entire document as Trello will say it is not complete yet on my completed list. It also allows the course teacher to keep track of where I am up to and help me if necessary. Using GitHub has helped so much for my project too as when uploading the work online, it means I can then access it from home or wherever I want and work on it there too. It also allows me to manage the different versions of code I produce due to it being contained on the IDE and online on GitHub where if one save messes up or hardware fails I can always have a backup.</p>
 <h3><u>1.7</u></h3>
   <p>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</p>
   <p>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was implemented in 2018 and designed to protect the data of individuals as a data protection law. It changes how businesses are able to handle the information of their customers. The impact of this law for businesses means that companies that hold personal data will have to be more structured and transparent with how they do things. 
     <br>
      People are now able to access, change, delete or even transfer any of their personal information that is being held by the companies system. That whichever company wishes for personal data to be held then they must get explicit consent from the person and then save the consent before they hold it. If there are any breaches of data security then the data authorities and consumers but be informed within 72 hours.
     <br>
      The impact when doing any digital projects, you have to remember that explicit consent is now required before any data collection, it has to be freely given, there must be positive opt-in consent and cannot be completed through pre-ticked boxes or inactivity and you must also save that consent too. The company must also inform the people how you will be storing that data collected and what it is going to be used for while also allowing them to access their data if requested. If the user wishes to have their information forgotten by the company then they can withdraw consent and take the data back from the company.

<h2><u>Outcome 2</u></h2>
   <p>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful</p>
 <h3><u>Scenario</u></h3>
   <p>Now you have set up your blog, it’s time to get into the details. You now need to critically review your website. 
     <br>
      To the bottom of your website add a review section that contains the following information. </p>
 <h3><u>2.1</u></h3>
   <p>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</p>
   <p>I am very happy with the tools I used for the website as it helped me get the task done efficiently. Using Visual Studio Code allowed me to make the code for my website much easier as it would suggest and autofill the code whenever I start to type it in, which helped me a lot due to being inexperienced to coding and occasionally forgetting specific words or how they’re spelt. It was also a great IDE as it helped me manage my folders and files a lot easier.
     <br><br>
      Using Trello was very helpful as whenever possible and when I remembered I would keep updating it and following it as a guide to getting the project done. Regardless of it being a solo project, team or not, Trello (or equivalent) is very important so that way the project doesn’t go off the path and the end result is the same as planned at the start in the planning phase.
     <br><br>
      Using the internet definitely helped me a load because while creating the website, I made a few mistakes and whenever I was unsure on what it was or needed help, I would always research the solution and figure it out by my own before I would ask for help as if I was at home surrounded by nothing but my Cat.
     <br><br>
      Overall I am happy with the tools, the only thing I could say would be maybe next time I should use additional tools to utilise the full potential of website development. Photoshop or Microsoft Paint is my first suggestion to myself rather than clicking and dragging images into my website HTML folder and using them, I could edit them first so that way they blend with the website or at the very least, looks a bit more presentable.</p>
 <h3><u>2.2</u></h3>
   <p>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</p>
   <p>The IT tools I used to develop my website were visual studio code, Trello and the internet for research.
     <br><br>
      Using visual studio code helped me develop my code for the website, which really helped me opposed to using notepad as the IDE helped suggest any code that I was unsure about and it was great to autofill the code for me. It also helped me keep all my files together and it felt very simplistic to navigate through. It was highly appropriate as for someone new to coding and HTML/CSS it felt like the IDE was supporting me a little bit and also encouraged me to experiment and push my limits.
     <br><br>
      Using Trello helped me keep track of any work that needed doing and gave me a reminder on what needs doing whenever I forget. It helped my course teacher keep track of where I am up to with my work and can see what it is I am actually doing.
      Using the internet helped me a lot because if I was stuck on anything I was doing, which was quite a few times, I always had the internet to cover my back. I also used it to help me implement additional features and make my website a little bit better than it would have been if I were to not research.</p>
 <h3><u>2.3</u></h3>
   <p>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</p>
   <p>I am very happy with how my website has turned out. The structure of it feels like a typical website to use and navigate through. I chose colours that work together and makes it visible for someone to read. I added a background to some text elements so that way it draws the eye to it as it’s something important, this is things like the navigation bar and some specific headings. 
     <br><br>
      I experimented a bit on a separate page that I will focus solely on my own interests called my page (my personal page) with embedding my own youtube video adding to a recruit operator theme in my favourite game followed by a big table containing a drinking game I made up for me and my girlfriend while ending up with a beautiful design for the said table having a black background with opacity/transparency turned up on it so the page background is still visible through the table but ever so slightly so that it doesn’t disrupt the table.
     <br><br>
      The weaknesses for my page I can see so far is that it could do with more features and content, things like more images and text as the website feels a little too boring to visit right now. It needs to have that feeling of a popular website on the internet. Perhaps add a slideshow of images that flick back and forth every 10+ seconds on the homepage. A page to also link all my social media accounts together with the logo next to it would be nice. Perhaps a parent and child drop-down box system for the navigation bar to navigate to pages buried within pages like the Codenation page, rather than having to go to “my work” just to be able to go to the CodeNation work.</p>
 <h3><u>2.4</u></h3>
   <p>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</p>
   <p>As of writing this, I’m not too happy with the colours of the website, it all works well together as a colour scheme in having good readability (which is a huge plus as it needs to be easily read!). I am just not a fan of the colours and will be looking to change the scheme from a brown background, gold font colour and a black background to highlight it (in specific areas) to something a lot more suited to me.
     <br><br>
      Most of my further improvements are listed on the previous question but I would like to improve the website so that it contains all my work produced during my college course years as it is currently buried on a USB drive somewhere in my bedroom gathering dust. I would also like for it to be somewhat similar to my WordPress online portfolio as I feel like that looks somewhat professional. 
     <br><br>
      Another improvement I could implement could be to make it compatible with every form of device that can access the internet, if not, at least make it so it’s not zoomed in too much when using different pc monitor screens i.e iMac to a small laptop.</p>
 <h3><u>2.5</u></h3>
   <p>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</p>
   <p>For my project, I have met the requirements as required.
     <br><br>
      I have prepared the appropriate content for each web page, for example on the homepage I have put an image of myself with a heading welcoming the user to the website, with a paragraph under the image giving a brief overview of the website and the purpose of it. The about me page contains a clearer image of me with a paragraph underneath it explaining who I am and what I want out of life while also meeting the requirements of this assignment.
     <br><br>
      On the next page is “my work” page. It so far contains a picture of me working in college, and underneath that will be links to additional pages which will contain all my pieces of work eventually; an online portfolio if you will. There is one link there so far but the one link takes you to another page that is called CodeNation and at the top, you are greeted with the logo of CodeNation to show that the page is about the CodeNation company and the course I have done with them.
     <br><br>
      The next page is my gallery which will contain images that I feel are relevant for the website, so far I’ve only thrown in some of the images I have included in the website but eventually, I will include my artwork, such as photoshop images I have created during projects and in my own time. I will also include any brief descriptions underneath each image to give purpose to them.
     <br><br>
      My final page is called “my page” which is my own personal page that I’d like to customise how I like that suits me and my interests. I desire it not to be professional but more of an experimental page I can tweak with, with many features to try out.
     <br><br>
      I have done my best to make the website as clear and understandable as possible to my current skill level. Any file formats I have used within the website have been compatible so I haven’t needed to change the file type as of yet.
     <br><br>
      Overall I would say the website matches the requirements and are fit for purpose.</p>
<h2><u>Outcome 3</u></h2>
   <p>Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems</p>
 <h3><u>Scenario</u></h3>
   <p>Continued from the previous task.</p> 
 <h3><u>3.1</u></h3>
   <p>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</p>
   <p>The benefits and drawbacks of using the IT tools that I did were:
     <br><br>
      With Trello, it helped me keep track of where I was up to with my work, so when I forgot what I was doing I could look at the Trello board and remember, while also I could add any ideas or features that I wish to implement or are required to make it into a basic functioning website. Aside from my uses for using it, it also allowed the course teacher to access it and see where I am up to while I make sure it is up to date.
     <br><br>
      The only drawback to using Trello that I found is sometimes I will get ahead of myself with my project and Trello will be trailing behind with what I need to do as I forget to update it as I go along which can sometimes confuse me and also require me to spend time updating the board catching up on what I’ve actually completed. 
     <br><br>
      With visual studio code, it benefited me because as an IDE it was similar to a babysitter, for example when typing in coding keywords, the software would suggest the word for me before I even finish typing it in, which helps me as if I was using notepad I wouldn’t get any suggestions or help. So it definitely helped me with the productivity as if I would’ve used notepad it would’ve taken me longer to finish and learn on, especially due to it not having code completion/checking.
     <br><br>
      There aren’t many drawbacks that I’ve found for Visual studio code other than it can be slow at certain times but there’s a possibility of instability or crashing depending on the computer, which would, in turn, slow the computer down too, which could be annoying especially if you aren’t saving after every change you make. 
     <br><br>
      Using the internet and researching it really benefited me as I could take note of websites I visit and get a general idea on what makes a good website. I could then do some research on how to implement the different kinds of features some websites have. If I was unsure about anything I was working on I could then research it using google and check several websites for a basic understanding of what it is.
     <br><br>
      The drawbacks of using the internet for this project is that when I am researching something I’m struggling with, some websites have over complicated answers that just confuse me and some websites have the wrong answer which usually results in me asking for help from the course teacher or from someone in my class group.
     <br><br>
      I imagine the website would be done better and much faster if we developed it in teams, the colour schemes, layouts and all the content would be very professional and advanced because where one person lacks, another person might excel at. 
     <br><br>
      [1]</p>
 <h3><u>3.2</u></h3>
   <p>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</p>
   <p>The ways I would improve productivity would have to be by scheduling what work I could do in the specific period of time and then set a realistic timer for myself for each task, so that way I try and stick to completing it in time and not spend time twiddling thumbs and procrastinating. Also by making lunch at home or getting it ready to eat when I have my break so that way I don’t have to leave the building as this gives me extra time to work on the project or at the very least, review what I have done so far so there aren’t any unnoticed mistakes. This will in total improve efficiency as well but by scheduling my work can free up some extra time, in the end, to improve the product and also allow any extra finishing touches to be implemented. </p>
 <h3><u>3.3</u></h3>
   <p>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?</p>
   <p>Next time what I would do differently would be to watch a lot of videos on the internet on people giving tutorials on how to do the specific features I would like to implement such as parent/child drop boxes on my navigation bar, for example, to make it easier to navigate through the website and subpages hidden from the navigation bar and also a load more other features that would be a great aspect for my website or the website I develop in future for clients/practice. 
     <br><br>
      Also utilising all the tools I have at hand to improve the end result of the digital project, for example rather than use just visual studio, Trello, Slack and the internet browser for research; I could use software like photoshop, perhaps make GUI designs/storyboards on some software to experiment how I’m going to make the layout and then pick one or get a second opinion from someone else or ask several people. 
     <br><br>    
      If it’s a project that may be too big or too difficult and researching isn’t giving a result I could seek help from the team I am in or perhaps ask online for help. Maybe even consider working the project as a team project opposed to working alone if the project seems too big. If I were to work in a team I would utilise slack and Trello to its full purpose as a team opposed to doing my own thing and implementing random junk that isn’t necessary.</p>
 <h3><u>3.4</u></h3>
   <p>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p>
   <p>To test the digital project (website) I have to check if all the content and the entire website loads on every browser installed to the computer, this is browsers like, google chrome, opera, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and even Safari. If all the content such as colours, images, text and features are showing the next step is to then test if all the webpages are linked properly and work correctly. Once the website has been checked if you can navigate through it all, that is when you check if all the features are working correctly; this is things like drop boxes, any text fields and forms that submit data and any other additional feature implemented. 
     <br><br>
      You need to also ask if it meets the requirements set for the project, whether it’s set by yourself or a customer, it still should have requirements set for good practice. Once this is tested it should be tested from an external computer if it is online (opposed to just one computer). If all the requirements are met and all the required testing is successful then it should all be good to go.</p>

<h2><u>Unit 2</u></h2>
<h2><u>Outcome 1</u></h2>
   <p>Create structures and styles for a webpage</p>
 <h3><u>Scenario</u></h3>
   <p>You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page</p>
 <h3><u>1.1</u></h3>
   <p>Describing the content and layout for each page</p>
   <p>“Homepage” is the landing page that anyone who comes to the website will automatically be pulled onto. I will use this page to display any news or things I want to address before people start venturing through the navigation bar. This page has a navigation bar at the top that allows the user to navigate throughout the website and underneath that is a heading that welcomes the user to the page. Under the heading contains an image representing myself and that it’s my personal website. Underneath that is a brief paragraph of what the website is and why I made it.
     <br><br>
      “About Me” is the next page on the navigation bar and this page contains a navigation bar too, following that is a heading saying the page is “about me” and under that is a clearer image of myself to show what I look like with a paragraph underneath that explaining a little about myself such as why I chose the course and what I want to happen for my future. Any new things to say about myself such as skills learnt or new hobbies will be placed on this page and updated from time to time.
     <br><br>            
      “My Work” is the page containing all my work I want to be uploaded for any potential employers to see and be impressed by or see as evidence that I’ve done as advertised. This is the next page on the navigation bar and this page contains a navigation bar too, following that is a heading saying the page is “my work” and under that is an image of me in college taking photographic evidence for my assignment that I’ve cleaned a pc with the appropriate products. Then underneath the image is a link to my coursework that is done with CodeNation.
     <br><br>
      “CodeNation” is a page that isn’t on the navigation bar but it has a navigation bar at the top and is accessed by the “my work” page as a link, the reason why this page isn’t displayed is that this is a child page opposed to every other page being a parent, it is nested essentially. This page contains a heading under the navigation bar saying “CodeNation coursework” and underneath it is the CodeNation company logo to advertise what it is with a hyperlink attached to it leading to the company website. Underneath the logo contains a smaller heading that has a title of “website development” which contains unit 1 and unit 2 jump links that automatically pull you to the specified unit in the assignment, the assignment being right underneath the Unit 1 and Unit 2 jump link.
     <br><br>
      “Gallery” is my page I will use to implement any images I wish to be displayed for the website and contain images contained within the entire website so I can explain them further. this is the next page on the navigation bar and this page contains a navigation bar too, following that is a heading saying the page is “Gallery” and under that is a few images I have used within the website, with a brief description underneath them explaining what they are.
     <br><br>
      “My Page” is my own personal page that contains my own content and meant to be my unprofessional artistic side of the website opposed to the other pages. This is the next page on the navigation bar and this page contains a navigation bar too, following that is a heading saying the page is “my personal page” and under that contains an image that acts as a banner for the top of the page, underneath that is an embedded youtube video that I have created and uploaded which has been set to autoplay when the page is opened. Following that, underneath is a big table containing an alcohol drinking game that I have made that I uploaded to be able to be accessed anywhere, rather than on my computer and being opened using Microsoft Word. It also means I can share my inventions and creations with friends via a simple link as opposed to constantly downloading pdf files.</p>
 <h3><u>1.5</u></h3>
   <p>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</p>
   <p>Copyright is a form of protection that provides creators with some security to protect their work from being stolen/taken by other people who shouldn’t have access and permission to the creator’s work. This work can range from music, literary, artwork such as paintings and images plus loads more. The copyright law prevents people from reproduction, distribution of the product, displaying it publicly, development of derivative works (meaning, copying the creators work to a certain degree).  [1]</p>
 <h3><u>1.6</u></h3>
   <p>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them</p>
   <p>People who have audible/hearing impairment or deaf may struggle to understand some of the information contained in a website that has a lot of audio; such as videos, songs or even screen readers. So to suit the needs for those people it is a good idea to implement features that allow the user to know what is going on, where is necessary, subtitles for videos and speech recognition software that converts speech into text would be ideal to help them out loads.
     <br><br>
      People who have a visual impairment or being blind will struggle reading some of the content and require audio as information, so when they are looking at a block of text, as they can’t see it properly they will need to have the text read-out for them, so a screen reader would be required.
     <br><br>
      People with cognitive disabilities may struggle to understand some information contained in the page so anyone with disabilities understanding certain words or pieces of information, it would be a good idea to implement an “alt tag” that for example when highlighting an image with the mouse cursor, it would give a brief description of that image opposed to leaving the user confused with no clue.
     <br><br>
      People with motor skills/physical disabilities will often have problems controlling the mouse and clicking accurately so making sure the pages buttons and links aren’t too small to click is very important, perhaps implementing the feature so when zooming into the page more it won’t ruin the entire shape and layout of the webpage, any other features that help a user navigate through a website when they struggle to use their hands can help improve accessibility.
     <br><br>

 <h3><u>1.7</u></h3>
   <p>Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</p>
   <p>There are many file types that can be implemented into websites, the best way to figure out the most appropriate file type, however, is to determine the most used ones and the ones that are required for the website. An example of putting a file type that no one uses or needs could result with compatibility issues and may even require the user to need to install additional software to their computer, which in turn will put people off the website and result in a smaller audience affecting the business.
     <br><br>
      The website should already contain the file types of HTML and CSS but additional file types are usually mp3 for music/sound files, mp4 for video files, “JPG/JPEG/PNG” are often used for the image files if the website contains images, while the GIF file format is used for an animated image. 
     <br><br>
      Often any work created using Microsoft Office, such as Word and Powerpoint, are often saved as a PDF file type opposed to a DOC or PPSX file type so that way it makes them into a smaller file size while also making it so it’s not possible to edit/modify unless using third party software, it is also a lot easier to read as if it is like a big image.
     <br><br>
      A lot of websites will also have it so folders are compressed into ZIP file types, which makes it easier to download and keeps it all together. The EXE file type is often used too when downloading programs from the internet to install to the computer.
