    <p>Hello and welcome to my website, I have made this as a project for my CodeNation course I enrolled onto. This
    website will be used as my Online Portfolio that I will use to display my work and skills off to any jobs I apply for.
    As of right now this website is very basic but functional, which once day I hope to change that and improve it to
    its full potential.</p><br>
    
    <p>From the course I have completed I feel much more confident in Website Development with HTML & CSS and I feel like
        I can move onto the next step towards my main goal now I have learned the basics.
    </p>
